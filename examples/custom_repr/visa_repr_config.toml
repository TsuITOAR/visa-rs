# Custom VISA repr configuration example
# 
# This file demonstrates how to customize repr mappings for your specific needs.
# Place this file named "visa_repr_config.toml" in the root of your crate
# (same directory as Cargo.toml) and build with the "cross-compile" feature.

# Platform-invariant types (same on all platforms)
[invariant]
ViUInt16 = "u16"
ViInt16 = "i16"

# Platform-dependent unsigned types
[platform_dependent.unsigned]
types = ["ViUInt32", "ViEvent", "ViEventType", "ViEventFilter", "ViAttr"]

# Custom mapping - for example, forcing all to u32 regardless of platform
[[platform_dependent.unsigned.mappings]]
condition = 'any()'
repr = "u32"

# Platform-dependent signed types
[platform_dependent.signed]
types = ["ViStatus", "ViInt32"]

# Custom mapping - for example, forcing all to i32 regardless of platform
[[platform_dependent.signed.mappings]]
condition = 'any()'
repr = "i32"
