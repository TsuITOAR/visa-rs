# Custom VISA repr configuration example
#
# This file demonstrates how to customize repr mappings for your specific needs.
# Place this file named "visa_repr_config.toml" in the root of your crate
# (same directory as Cargo.toml), or set VISA_REPR_CONFIG_PATH to its path.
# With "cross-compile" it is optional; with "custom-repr" it is required.
